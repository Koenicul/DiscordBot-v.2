AITA for beating the shit out of my little sister?

So I wanna prephase this by saying me and my sister are very close and always have been. 
We go to the same school, are in the same grade, and completely inseperable. 
She has, however, always hung out with me a little less than her friends ever since we went to high school. 
In middle school, we would always participate in the same clubs, sports, etc. you name it. 
But now, my best friend has been hanging out with other people over me. 
I approached her about this every day until she told me to leave her alone. 
Now I should let you know I have intermittent explosive disorder and I get really irrationally angry at times so it isn't my fault that this happened, 
but I just started throwing punches left and right at her. 
At the time, we were in her bedroom, so all the blood coming from her nose and lip was getting all over her bed and carpet. 
Eventually, maybe the 12th or so right hook, I shoved her into her dresser and she accidentally knocked her head on the corner and fell unconscious. 
I thought of dialing 911, but letting her succumb to her injuries for a temporary amount of time seemed like just punishment in my eyes, 
so I set a timer on my phone for 1 hour but forgot about it and left my phone somewhere I couldn't hear it. 
Eventually, when our parents got home from work, they were distraught and accused me of being a monster. However, 
it is genuinely her fault as I am just a victim of her emotional abuse, tossed to the side when she didn't wanna play with me anymore. 
It has always been her fault in my eyes. BTW she is fighting for her life in the ER at the moment. I don't recall word for word what they said, 
but something something blood vessel bursted something something cranial fluid something something pressure. Not much important, 
but she can recover because she is young and I honestly think everybody is making a whole big ordeal out of this and making her out to be the victim. 

So, Reddit, AITA?
